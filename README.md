# CodeCamp Community

**Name: Lowella Fox**

**Description** 
* Students can create a thread of topic related to their code camp bootcamp class or just to keep up with everybody. They can also reply or post a comment to the forums posted by another student.

* This app is created using Node Express for creating API (application layer), mySQL for database (data layer) and React for the front-end (presentation layer).

* Deployed Link: https://codecamp-community.herokuapp.com/login


**Functionality** 
1. The user needs to create an account before they can login to the page.
2. Click the Sign up link to create an account. After that, you can now login to the page.
3. Once the user is logged in, a home page will be displayed with a side bar menu (Home & My Post).
4. The Side bar menu Home, displays all the post from all users. When a user clicks on a specific post they can reply to the post or post a comment.
5. The My Post link displays all the posts of the user that is currently logged in. On that link, the user can create, update and delete their post.

**Technologies Used** 
* Node Express, React, MySQL, bootstrap, CSS, Ant Design

**Ideas for Future Improvement**
 1. The user can also update and delete their comments in the forums.
 2. There should be an admin or moderator type of user to check if the post and comments are appropriate or not.
 3. There should be a feature where the user (the one who posted the topic) can mark the comments of another user check or correct.

**User Stories**
1. As a student, I want to ask everybody how they've been doing to keep up with them.
2. As a student, I want to ask questions about a topic I got stuck up with, so I can gather ideas from them.
3. As a student, I want to read a post from other students, so I can help them if I know the answer to their questions.
